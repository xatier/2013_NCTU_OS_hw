A Quick Start Guide
====

### Step 1. Get example code
You can clone the example code from github

    git clone https://github.com/RuKuWu/2013_NCTU_OS_hw.git

Or you can just download the zip file from github and unzip it

P.S. - if you use the workstations of nctu-cs, git is already installed.
### Step 2. Build the code
Go to the dir which example code located in

    cd 2013_NCTU_OS_hw1-master

Then build all src code by

    make

Or you can build each part by

    make [ fork | fifo | shm ]

## A. Process Information

In Linux, most of things are implemented as special files, so as runtime process. `/proc` is a virtual directory.
You can get the information of running processes by looking up files and directories in this folder.

Now, we will show how to get the information from `/proc`.

### Step 1.

>   Open any application you want to observe. 
We use Firefox as example, which is a default browser in most of linux-based operating systems.

### Step 2.

>   Type `ps aux` (it is distinct of `ps -aux`) or `ps fax` in terminal to list all running processes.  
Then, type `ps aux | grep firefox` to show process information of firefox.(Remember the pid of firefox)

>   `ps` and `grep` are build-in program in linux. First of one can list all processes in operating system,
the other one can filter the input and just print out what you want.  

>   If you want to know more details of these two program, type `man ps` and `man grep` in terminal.

### Step 3.

>   Type `pstree [PID]` and you can see the processes tree of firefox.  
Type `cd /proc/[PID]; ls` and you can see all things about the process of firefox.

## B. Linux Multi-Process Programming

In this part, we will tall you how to write a multi-process program in linux environment.
If you are already familiar with this, you can skip this part.

### Before coding: some of our suggestion
1.  Programming language  
>   Basic C/C++ knowledge is required.

2.  Editor  
>   Vim is recommonded. However, you can use any editor you like.  
>   If you are finding a suitable editor, you can try 
[gedit](https://projects.gnome.org/gedit/), [bluefish](http://bluefish.openoffice.nl/index.html), [code::blocks](http://www.codeblocks.org/) and [sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com/).

3.  Makefile  
>   Makefile can help you build the src code and save time.  

### Fork

`fork()` duplicates the calling process.
The origin process is called as 'parent', duplicate is called as 'child'.  
`fork()` returns pid of child process in parent and return 0 in child. If `fork()` is failed, -1 is returned.

If you want to know more details of fork, type `man fork` in terminal.

#### * Example 1-1 fork
```C
  #include <unistd.h>
  
  pid_t fork(void);
```

>   This example show the basic use of fork.
>   In the example, fork is called and create the child process.  
>   Usually, we use if statement to decide actions of each process.

```C 
  cpid = fork();
  if (cpid < 0) { /* failed */
  } else if (cpid == 0) { /* child process */
  } else { /* parent process */ }
```

>   You can see two of them use same variable "str" as print string buffer; however, they print out different content.  
>   That is because when fork is called, child process is assigned its own memory space. Thus, they would not change any variable which belongs to each other.

#### * Example 1-2 fork with waitpid 

```C
  #include <sys/types.h>
  #include <sys/wait.h>
  
  pid_t waitpid(pid_t pid, int *status, int options);
```

>   We extend the example 1-1 to show how waitpid works. 
`waitpid()` is a function to let parent  process wait for any child process to end.

>   In our example, child uses a file to leave a message to parent. 
If parent reads before child writes, no content will be read.  
>   Thus, Parent should be paused, waiting for end of file writing of child and then parent could read the file. 
In the program, parent calls the `waitpid()` to wait for child to end.

>   `waitpid(-1, 0, 0)` means waiting for all children done, same as `wait(0)`.  
>   If you want more details of `waitpid()`, type `man waitpid` in terminal.

### Named pipe (a.k.a. FIFO)

Pipeline is a useful mechanism in Unix/Linux based system. 
It creates a buffer in kernal to let a program push messages to this buffer and any program knowing the pipe descriptor can pop out messages from it.

In [Part A - Step 2](https://github.com/RuKuWu/2013_NCTU_OS_hw#step-2), we use a command `ps aux | grep firefox`. It's a use of pipeline. 
`command A | command B` means to pipe the output of A to B as input via a anonymous pipeline. 
Thus, in command `ps aux | grep firefox`, the output of `ps aux` is redirected to `grep firefox` as input.

First, we will introducte the anonymous pipeline in example 2-1 to let you know how pipeline works.  
Then, in exmample 2-2 and 2-3, we will talk about named pipe(FIFO) and show you what's a difference between anonymous and named pipe.

#### * Example 2-1 pipe
```C
  #include <unistd.h>
  
  int pipe(int pipefd[2]);
```


>   In this example, we call `pipe()` to create a pipeline for interprocess communication. 
When `pipe()` is called,  it will give out two file descriptors which are not point to a file but a kernal buffer.
The first descriptor fd[0] is for popping things from memory, the second descriptor fd[1] is for pushing.

```C 
  pipe(fd);
  cpid = fork();
  if ( cpid < 0 ){ /*failed*/
  } else if ( cpid == 0 ) { /* child process, send a message to parent */
    close(fd[0]); /* close a unused read pipe fd */
    write(fd[1], buf, sizeof(char) * (strlen(buf)+1) );
    close(fd[1]);
  } else { /* parent process, recv message from child */
    close(fd[1]); /* close a unused write pipe fd */
    read(fd[0], buf, sizeof(char) * BUFFER_SIZE);
    close(fd[0]);
  }
```

>   **Please note that** `pipe()` should be called before `fork()`. 
That is because all processes should know the file descriptors of pipeline.
If `pipe()` is put after `fork()`, only the process calling `pipe()` has correct value of the descriptors.
In contrast, if putting `pipe()` before `fork()`, value of the file descriptors is copied to child process and child process can also use the descriptors. 

>   If you want to know more details of `pipe()`, type `man pipe` in terminal.

#### * Example 2-2 FIFO

```C
  #include <sys/types.h>
  #include <sys/stat.h>
  
  int mkfifo(const char *pathname, mode_t mode);
```

>   Named pipeline (a.k.a. FIFO) is same as anonymous pipeline, but creating a special file. 
This file let communication between two unrelated processes, which have no parent-child relation, becomes possible. 
But in this example, we show the basic use at first.

>  To use named pipeline, `mkfifo()` is called to create a named pipeline file. 
And then you need open the file to use the pipeline **(use `open()`, not `fopen()`)**. 
After those, you can use it just as a regular file.

```C
  mkfifo(path, 0666);
  if ( cpid < 0 ) { /* failed */
  } else if ( cpid == 0 ) { /* child process, send a message */
    fd = open(path, O_WRONLY);
    write(fd, str, sizeof(char)*(strlen(str)+1));
    close(fd);
  } else {
    fd = open(path, O_RDONLY);
    read(fd, str, sizeof(char)*BUFFER_SIZE);
    close(fd);
  }
```

#### * Example 2-3 link two unrelated processes by FIFO

>  You can create a named pipeline file by your hand. 
Type `mkfifo test` in terminal and you can see the file named "test". 

    prw-rw-r--  1 root root 0M 10æœˆ  3 00:35 test
    
>  As above, the first flag of the file is 'p', which means pipeline file. 
A pipeline file links to a kernal buffer, instead of disk. 
You can use it to do interprocess communication. 

>  Open a new terminal and type `ls > test` in it. you can see nothing printed. Don't worry, things are quite normal.  
>  Open another terminal and type `cat < test`. Surprisingly, what should be printed on first terminal appear on the second terminal.  
>  That is because the output of `ls` is buffered, and then `cat` take them from "test" as input to display. 

>  The code "2-3" does similar things as above.  
>  If you want to know more details of mkfifo, type `man mkfifo` and `man 3 mkfifo` in terminal.

### Shared memory

A shared memory let two or more processes share a chunk of memory. All of them can access to this memory directly. 
You can image all these processes draw on the same paper, any of them can add and remove graphs anytime, anywhere. 
Thus, there is a problem if two or more processes access to same location at the same time. 

#### * Example 3-1 Shared memory

>  This is a example of basic use of shared memory. There are three main function - `shmget()`, `shmat(), `shmdt()`.

```C
  #include <sys/ipc.h>
  #include <sys/shm.h>
  
  int shmget(key_t key, size_t size, int shmflg);
  
  void *shmat(int shmid, const void *shmaddr, int shmflg);
  int shmdt(const void *shmaddr);
```

>  `shmget()` creates a chunk of memory.
